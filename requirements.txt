# TensorTune v1.1.0 Requirements

# Core GUI dependency
customtkinter>=5.2.0

# --- Optional but highly recommended for full functionality ---

# System information, process management (used by core for CPU threads, process killing)
psutil>=5.9.0

# NVIDIA GPU VRAM monitoring (used by core)
# Install if you have an NVIDIA GPU.
pynvml>=11.5.0

# Enhanced CLI user interface (used by tensortune_cli.py)
# Recommended for a better CLI experience.
rich>=13.4.0

# Consistent application directories (used by core if available)
# Provides better platform-agnostic paths for config/data.
appdirs>=1.4.4

# --- Platform-Specific for Advanced GPU Info (Install manually if needed) ---
# These are used by tensortune_core.py for more detailed GPU information on specific platforms.
# TensorTune will attempt to use them if installed but can function without them
# (though GPU info might be limited for the respective vendors).

# For AMD GPUs on Windows (detailed VRAM & listing):
# May require AMD Adrenalin Software with the ADLX SDK components.
# Consider installing if you have an AMD GPU on Windows and need precise info.
# Example pip install (might vary): pip install pyadlx

# For Windows Management Instrumentation (fallback GPU info on Windows):
# Generally available on Windows, but this library provides a Python interface.
# Install if other methods fail or for general WMI access.
# pip install wmi

# For Intel GPUs using Level Zero API (detailed VRAM & listing):
# May require Intel drivers and the Level Zero runtime.
# Package name is often 'pyze-l0'.
# pip install pyze-l0

# Metal bindings for macOS are typically part of the system Python or an environment
# that supports Metal development. Not usually a separate pip install.

# --- Notes ---
# tkinter: Comes with most Python installations. If missing (especially on Linux),
# install it via your system's package manager.
#   - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#   - Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
#   - Windows/macOS: Usually included with the official Python installer from python.org.
