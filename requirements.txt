# TensorTune v1.1.0 Requirements

# Core GUI dependency
customtkinter>=5.2.0

# --- Optional but highly recommended for full functionality ---

# System information, process management (used by core for CPU threads, process killing)
psutil>=5.9.0

# NVIDIA GPU VRAM monitoring (used by core)
# Install if you have an NVIDIA GPU.
# pip install pynvml
pynvml>=11.5.0

# Enhanced CLI user interface (used by tensortune_cli.py)
# Recommended for a better CLI experience.
# pip install rich
rich>=13.4.0

# Consistent application directories (used by core if available)
# Provides better platform-agnostic paths for config/data.
# pip install appdirs
appdirs>=1.4.4

# --- Platform-Specific for Advanced GPU Info (Install manually if needed) ---
# TensorTune attempts to use these for more detailed GPU information if available.

# For Windows systems (fallback GPU info, general system info)
# pip install WMI
wmi>=1.5.1

# For AMD GPUs on Windows (provides detailed VRAM & listing if ADLX SDK is present):
# PyADLX is NOT a standard pip package. It requires manual building against the
# AMD ADLX SDK, typically installed with AMD Adrenalin Software.
# See TensorTune README or AMD's ADLX documentation for more details.
# (No pip install line here as it's a manual build process)

# For Intel GPUs using Level Zero API (detailed VRAM & listing):
# May require Intel drivers and the Level Zero runtime to be installed first.
# pip install pyze-l0
# pyze-l0>=0.1.0


# --- Notes ---
# tkinter: Comes with most Python installations. If missing (especially on Linux),
# install it via your system's package manager.
#   - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
#   - Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
#   - Windows/macOS: Usually included with the official Python installer from python.org.
