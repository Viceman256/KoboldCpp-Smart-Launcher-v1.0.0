# TensorTune v1.1.1 - Changelog

### Added
- **Context-Aware Library Status Warnings (CLI & GUI):** Startup messages for optional GPU monitoring libraries (PyADLX, PyZE, WMI, Metal) are now more relevant to the user's detected hardware, significantly reducing irrelevant log noise.
- **CLI: Option to Suppress Optional Library Warnings:** Users can now toggle a setting in the CLI to hide non-critical optional library status messages after the first successful run. Critical warnings (e.g., for Psutil, or PyNVML if NVIDIA GPU is targeted) will still display.
- **Detailed Setup Guides for Optional Libraries:**
    - `PYADLX_SETUP_GUIDE.md`: For manual setup of PyADLX (AMD GPUs on Windows).
    - `PYZE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`: For PyZE/`pyze-l0` (Intel Arc/Xe GPUs).
    - `WMI_SETUP_GUIDE.md`: For the WMI Python package (Windows fallback).
- Core error messages for these libraries now direct users to these new guides.
- `appdirs` added to `requirements.txt` and default generation in `tensortune_install.py` for consistent config/data path management.

### Changed
- **Improved Startup Logging (CLI & GUI):** Enhanced clarity and structure of initial diagnostic messages.
- **Updated Documentation:** `README.md`, `tensortune_examples.py`, and `tensortune_install.py` updated to reflect version 1.1.1, new features, and guide locations.
- **Core Error Messages:** Refined error messages in `tensortune_core.py` for PyADLX, PyZE, and WMI to be more informative and link to setup guides.
- **GUI Initialization Order:** Fine-tuned the `__init__` sequence in `tensortune_gui.py` for more robust startup and data availability for logging.

# TensorTune v1.1.0 - Changelog

## Overview
Version 1.1.0 brings significant enhancements across the board, focusing on improved GPU management, user experience in both GUI and CLI, more robust KCPP integration, and a major new "Set as Preferred" feature for tuning. This release also includes numerous bug fixes for increased stability and smoother operation.

---

## Core Improvements (`tensortune_core.py`)
-   **Enhanced GPU Detection & Error Handling:**
    -   More precise error reporting when GPU libraries (e.g., PyNVML, PyADLX) fail to initialize.
    -   Helpful hints on AMD Linux systems to install ROCm if `rocm-smi` is not found.
    -   SysFS fallback support for AMD and Intel GPUs on Linux, enabling basic GPU listing and VRAM detection even when primary tools are unavailable.
-   **KoboldCpp Capabilities:**
    -   Capabilities (e.g., CUDA support) are now cached per executable path to avoid redundant detection calls, speeding up subsequent startups.
    -   Clarification: KCPP capabilities detection primarily relies on parsing `koboldcpp_executable --help`. If a KCPP build incorrectly lists flags it doesn't support, TensorTune might optimistically detect them.
-   **Process Management:**
    -   Fixed a `TypeError` in `kill_processes_by_name` that occurred when process command line information (`cmdline`) was `None` or not iterable. This improves the robustness of the "Stop ANY KCPP Processes (Sweep)" feature.

---

## CLI Improvements (`tensortune_cli.py`)
-   **Robust User Interaction:**
    -   Redesigned input prompts to gracefully handle empty inputs, defaults, and user cancellations (Ctrl+C).
    -   Fixed an issue where the GGUF file selection prompt could immediately cancel with empty input.
-   **KoboldCpp Integration:**
    -   Validates and resolves the KCPP executable path using the same robust logic as the GUI.
    -   Automatically re-detects KCPP capabilities on first-time setup and when changing settings, updating GPU backend flags accordingly.
    -   Added interactive options to view/redetect KCPP capabilities and manage model-specific or global default arguments.
-   **Tuning Session Enhancements:**
    -   Correctly propagates tuning levels into KCPP launch commands for consistent GPU layer settings.
    -   Ensures VRAM availability is captured accurately right before direct launches (‚ÄúSkip Tune‚Äù or ‚ÄúLaunch Best‚Äù).
    -   Reconstructs ‚Äúbest remembered‚Äù launches using historical tuning levels and VRAM data for improved accuracy.
    -   Improved user stop tracking (e.g., Ctrl+C) during live monitoring sessions for smoother cancellation.
-   **Output and Display:**
    -   Resolved Rich progress bar errors by managing progress context correctly.
    -   Improved KCPP live output handling to integrate cleanly with Rich progress bars for a tidier console view.
-   **Configuration & Code:**
    -   Ensured more consistent updates to global CLI settings after changes.
    -   Improved handling of Python script paths for KCPP executables (e.g., `.py`, `.pyw`).

---

## GUI Improvements (`tensortune_gui.py`)
-   **New Feature: "Set as Preferred" Tuning Strategy:**
    -   After a successful monitored launch (VRAM OK/Tight), users can now mark that configuration as "preferred" for the current model.
    -   This preference is saved to the launch history with a distinct outcome (`_USER_MARKED_AS_BEST_GUI`).
    -   The "Launch Best Remembered Config" feature now prioritizes these user-marked preferred configurations.
-   **New Feature: Scrollable Auto-Tuning Session Page:**
    -   The "Auto-Tuning Session" page is now fully scrollable, ensuring all controls and information (post-monitoring choices, KCPP output log) are accessible regardless of window size.
-   **Enhanced User Experience & Layout:**
    -   ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù buttons for GGUF models now correctly start in user-configured default or last-used directories.
    -   First-time setup dialog initializes the last-used GGUF directory for a smoother initial browsing experience.
    -   Settings Tab: Collapsible sections (Global Arguments, KCPP Capabilities) now default to collapsed for a cleaner initial view.
    -   Settings Tab: Improved GPU selection dropdown layout and repositioned "GPU Status" label to prevent UI breakage on smaller windows.
    -   VRAM Display: Progress bars expanded for clarity, and GPU info/VRAM text moved below for better readability. Prevented duplicate "Manual Budget" prefix in VRAM messages.
    -   VRAM Monitoring: The "Launch & Monitor Output" button in the tuning view is now disabled if no GPU is detected or if it has no VRAM information (with a tooltip explaining why).
-   **Improved Process Control:**
    -   Added ‚ÄúStop Tracked KCPP Processes‚Äù button to selectively terminate only TensorTune-launched KoboldCpp instances.
    -   ‚ÄúStop Current Monitoring‚Äù button now available during monitoring sessions to safely abort operations, logging user stops in history.
    -   Button Color Tweak: ‚ÄúStop Tracked KCPP‚Äù button recolored to a darker orange/brown for better visual distinction.
-   **Bug Fixes & Stability:**
    -   Resolved `NameError` on GUI close by moving closing logic into a class method (`_on_gui_close_requested`) and correctly registering it.
    -   Corrected `if __name__ == "__main__":` block positioning in `tensortune_gui.py`.
    -   Added widget existence checks (`hasattr`, `winfo_exists`) and safe `TabView` access to prevent errors during view switching or if UI elements are not fully initialized.
    -   Fixed `AttributeError` issues with CTkOptionMenu/Button callbacks, particularly for Python 3.13 compatibility, by consistently using lambda functions.
    -   Resolved `TypeError` in VRAM calculation post-monitoring if GPU/VRAM info was unavailable.
    -   Fixed `ValueError` (e.g., invalid `pady` on CTkFrame) that caused UI misbehavior, particularly affecting tuning menu returns.
    -   Improved GPU ID dropdown selection logic for correct default choices when GPU lists or configurations change.
    -   Enhanced configuration load/save logic for booleans, empty inputs, and model-specific argument dialogs.
    -   More reliable VRAM monitoring and display updates linked to the current configuration.
    -   Improved history view stability and performance (widget existence checks, limited initial entries).
    -   Corrected exit confirmation dialog parenting.
    -   General code style improvements and `IndentationError` fixes.

---

## Repository Management
-   Added `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` to `.gitignore` and removed existing `__pycache__` folders from Git tracking to prevent committing Python bytecode.

---

## TensorTune v1.0.0 - Initial Release

This marks the first official release of TensorTune, rebranded from the KoboldCpp Smart Launcher, now with enhanced stability, GPU management, and user experience features.

üåü Key Features & Enhancements:

    Rebranded to TensorTune: New application name and identity.

        Configuration and history database files will now be stored under "TensorTune" specific paths (e.g., in ~/.config/TensorTune or AppData). Note: Existing settings from "KoboldCpp Smart Launcher" will not be automatically migrated.

    Improved Configuration Management:

        Automatic Updates: Configuration files are now automatically updated to the latest version, adding missing keys with default values, reducing startup errors after updates.

        Robust Loading: Enhanced handling of existing configuration files.

        (CLI & GUI): Export and Import full launcher configurations (settings only, not history DB).

        (CLI & GUI): Option to reset all settings to factory defaults with automatic backup of current config.

    Enhanced GPU Management & VRAM Reporting (Core, GUI, CLI):

        Target Specific GPUs: Users can now select a specific GPU vendor (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple) and then a specific GPU ID (if multiple are present) for VRAM monitoring.

        VRAM Budget Override: Manually set a total VRAM budget for the launcher to use in its calculations, useful if auto-detection is problematic or for testing scenarios.

        Accurate VRAM Logging: Database now correctly logs actual hardware free VRAM before launch and actual hardware KCPP VRAM usage after successful loads.

        Informed Tuning: "VRAM Tight" vs. "VRAM OK" decisions during monitored tuning are based on the (potentially overridden) budgeted free VRAM.

    Refined Auto-Tuning Heuristics (Core, GUI, CLI):

        The initial Tensor Offload (OT) level suggestion now better considers:

            Estimated model VRAM needs vs. the launcher's (potentially overridden) VRAM budget.

            Relevant successful or failed historical launch configurations, matched against actual current hardware VRAM.

    GUI Enhancements (v1.4.1 basis):

        New "GPU Management & VRAM Override" section in Settings.

        VRAM display on Main and Tuning tabs reflects GPU selection and VRAM override.

        Improved initial directory logic for "Browse" dialogs in First-Time Setup.

        Fixed History tab display issues (TclError).

        Corrected monitored KCPP output handling (byte stream decoding).

    CLI Enhancements (aligned with GUI features):

        New "Launcher Settings" menu for comprehensive configuration.

        Respects Tkinter dialog preference for model selection if set.

        Displays "Last Monitored Success" details during tuning.

        Resolved AttributeError with Rich Progress display.
